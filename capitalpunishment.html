            REFLECTIONS
            ON THE
            GUILLOTINE
            (From the book Reflexions sur la peine Capitale, a
            symposium by Arthur Koestler and Albert Camus, published
            by Calmann-Levy in 1957)
            Shortly before the war of 1914, an assassin whose crime
            was particularly repulsive (he had slaughtered a family of
            farmers, including the children) was condemned to death
            in Algiers. He was a farm worker who had killed in a sort
            of bloodthirsty frenzy but had aggravated his case by robbing
            his victims. The affair created a great stir. It was generally
            thought that decapitation was too mild a punishment
            for such a monster. This was the opinion, I have
            been told, of my father, who was especially aroused by 
            the murder of the children. One of the few things I know
            about him, in any case, is that he wanted to witness the
            execution, for the .first time in rus life. He got up in the
            dark to go to the place of execution at the other end of
            town amid a great crowd of people. What he saw that
            morning he never told anyone. My mother relates merely
            that he came rushing home, his face distorted, refused to
            talk, lay down for a moment on the bed, and suddenly
            began to vomit. He had just discovered the reality hidden
            under the noble phrases with which it was masked.
            Instead of thinking of the slaughtered children, he could
            think of nothing but Illat quivering body that had just
            been dropped onto a board to have its head cut off.
            Presumably that ritual act is horrible indeed if it manages
            to overcome the indignation of a simple, straightforward
            man and if a punishment he considered richly
            deserved had no other effect in the end than to nauseate
            him. When the extreme penalty Simply causes vomiting
            on the part of the respectable citizen it is supposed to
            protect, how can anyone maintain that it is likely, as it
            ought to be, to bring more peace and order into the community?
            Rather, it is obviously no less repulsive than
            the crime, and this new murder, far from making
            amends for the harm done to the social body, adds a new
            blot to the first one. Indeed, no one dares speak directly
            of the ceremony. Officials and journalists who have to
            talk about it, as if they were aware of both its provocative
            and its shameful aspects, have made up a sort of ritual
            language, reduced to stereotyped phrases. Hence we
            read at breakfast time in a corner of the newspaper that
            the condemned "has paid rus debt to society" or that he
            has "atoned" or that "at five a.m. justice was done." The
            officials call the condemned man "the interested party"
            ::>r "the patient" or refer to him by a number. People
            write of capital punishment as if they were whispering.
            In our well-policed society we recognize that an illness
            is serious from the fact that we don't dare speak of it directly.
            For a long time, in middle-class families people
            REFLECTIONS ON '!lIE GUILLOTlNB 133
            said no more than that the elder daughter had a "suspicious
            cough" or that the father had a "growth" because
            tuberculosis and cancer were looked upon as somewhat
            shameful maladies. This is probably even truer of capital
            punishment since everyone strives to refer to it only
            through euphemisms. It is to the body politic what cancer
            is to the individual body, with this difference: no one
            has ever spoken of the necessity of cancer. There is no
            hesitation, on the other hand, about presenting capital
            punishment as a regrettable necessity, a necessity that
            justifies killing because it is necessary, and let's not talk
            about it because it is "regrettable.
            But it is my intention to talk about it crudely. Not because
            I like scandal, nor, I believe, because of an un'
            healthy streak in my nature. As a writer, I have always
            loathed avoiding the issue; as a man, I believe that the
            repulsive aspects of our condition, if they are inevitable,
            must merely be faced in silence. But when silence or
            tricks of laaguage contribute to maintaining an abuse
            that must be reformed or a suffering that can be relieved,
            then there is no other solution but to speak out and show
            the obscenity hidden under the verbal cloak. France
            shares with England and Spain the honor of being one
            of the last countries this side of the iron curtain to keep
            c~pital punishment in its arsenal of repression. The surVIval
            of such a primitive rite has been made possible
            among us only by the thoughtlessness or ignorance of
            the public, which reacts only with the ceremonial
            phrases that have been drilled into it. When the imagination
            sleeps, words are emptied of their meaning: a deaf
            population absent-mindedly registers the condemnation
            of a man. But if people are shown the machine, made to
            touch the wood and steel and to hear the sound of a head
            falling, then public imagination, suddenly awakened,
            will repudiate both the vocabulary and the penalty.
            When the Nazis in Poland indulged in public executions
            of hostages, to keep those hostages from shouting
            words of revolt and liberty they muzzled them with a
            plaster-coated gag. It would be shocking to compare the
            fate <)f those innocent victims with that of condemned
            criminals. But, aside from the fact that criminals are not
            the only ones to be guillotined in our country, the
            method is the same. We smother under padded words a
            penalty whose legitimacy we could assert only after we
            had examined the penalty in reality. Instead of saying
            that the death penalty is hrst of all necessary and then
            adding that it is better not to talk about it, it is essential
            to say what it really is and then say whether, being what
            it is, it is to be considered as necessary.
            So far as I am concerned, I consider it not only useless
            but definitely harmful, and I must record my opinion
            here before getting to the subject itself. It would not be
            fair to imply that I reached this conclusion as a result of
            the weeks of investigation and research I have just devoted
            to this question. But it would be just as unfair to
            attribute my conviction to mere mawkishness. I am far
            from indulging in the flabby pity characteristic of humanitarians,
            in which values and responsibilities fuse,
            crimes are balanced against one another, and innocence
            finally loses its rights. Unlike many of my welHnown
            contemporaries, I do not think that man is by nature a
            social animal. To tell the truth, I think just the reverse.
            But I believe, and this is quite different, that he cannot
            live henceforth outside of society, whose laws are necessary
            to his physical survival. Hence the responsibilities
            must be established by society itself according to a reasonable
            and workable scale. But the law's final justification
            is in the good it does or fails to do to the society of a
            given place and time. For years I have been unable to
            :ee a.nyt~ing in capital punishment but a penalty the
            ImagmatlOn could not endure and a lazy disorder that
            my reason condemned. Yet I was ready to think that my
            imagination was influencing my judgment. But, to tell
            the truth, I found during my recent research nothing
            that did not strengthen my conviction, nothino that modified
            my arguments. On the contrary, to the a~guments J
            already had others we:re added. Today I share absolutely
            Koestler's conviction; the death penalty besmirches our
            society, and its upholders cannot reasonably defend it.
            Without repeating his decisive defense, without piling
            up facts and figures that would only duplicate others
            (and Jean Bloch-Michel's make them useless), I shall
            merely state reasons to be added to Koestler's; like his,
            they argue for an immediate abolition of the death
            penalty.
            We all know that the great argument of those who defend
            capital punishment is the exemplary value of the
            punishment. Heads are cut off not only to punish but to
            intimidate, by a frightening example, any who might be
            tempted to imitate the guilty. Society is not taking revenge;
            it merely wants to forestall. It waves the head in
            the air so that potential murderers will see their fate and
            recoil from it.
            This argument would be impressive if we were not
            obliged to note:
            I) that society itself does not believe in the exemplary
            value it talks about;
            2) that there is no proof that the death penalty ever
            made a single murderer :recoil when he had made up his
            mind, whereas clearly it had no effect but one of fascination
            on thousands of criminals;
            3) that, in other regards, it constitutes a repulsive
            example, the consequences of which cannot be foreseen.
            To begin with, society does not believe in what it says.
            If it really believed what it says, it would exhibit the
            heads. Society would give executions the benefit of the
            publicity it generally uses for national bond issues or
            new brands of drinks. But we know that executions in
            our country, instead of taking place publicly, are now
            perpetrated in prison courtyards before a limited number
            of specalists. We are less likely to know why and since
            when. This is a relatively recent measure. The last public
            execution, which took place in 1939, beheaded V/eidmann
            the author of several murders, who was notorious
            for hi~ crimes. That morning a large crowd gathered at
            Versailles, including a large number of photc)gr:ap!ler:s:.Â·
            Between the moment when Weidmann was to
            the crowd and the moment when he was decapitated,
            photographs could be taken. A few hours later Pa.ri$",
            Soir published a page of illustrations of that ...â€¢
            event. Thus the good people of Paris could see ..â€¢
            light precision instrument used by the executioner was
            as different from the historical scaffold as a Jaguar is '.
            from one of our old Pierce-Arrows. The administration
            and the goverrunent, contrary to all hope, took such
            cellent publicity very badly and protested that the
            had tried to satisfy the sadistic instincts of its
            Consequently, it was decided that executions would no
            longer take place publicly, an arrangement that, soon
            after, facilitated the work of the occupation authorities.
            Logic, in that affair, was not on the side of the lawmaker.
            On the contrary, a special decoration should have been
            awarded to the editor of Paris-Soir, thereby encouraging ..â€¢.
            him to do better the next time. If the penalty is intended
            to be exemplary, then, not only should the photographs
            be multiplied, but the machine should even 'be set Oll'.
            a platform in Place de la Concorde at two P.M., the entire
            population should be invited, and the ceremony
            should be put on television for those who couldn't attend.
            Either this must be done or else there must be no
            more talk of exemplary value. How can a furtive assassination
            committed at night in a prison courtyard be exemplary?
            At most, it serves the purpose of periodically
            informing the citizens that they will die if they happen
            to kill-a future that can be promised even to those who
            do not kill. For the penalty to be truly exemplary it
            must be frightening. Tuaut de La Bouverie, represent~
            ative of the people in 17SH and a partisan of public executions,
            was more logical when he declared to the Na-
            REFLECTIONS ON TIlE GUILLOTINE 137
            tionalAssembly: "It takes a terrifying spectacle to hold
            the people in check."
            Today there is no spectacle, but only a penalty known
            to all by hearsay and, from time to rime, the news of an
            execution dressed up in soothing phrases. How could .a
            future criminal keep in mind, at the moment of hIS
            crime, a sanction that everyone strives to make more and
            more abstract? And if it is really desired that he constantly
            keep that sanction in mind so that it will first balance
            and later reverse a frenzied decision, should there
            not be an effort to engrave that sanction and its dreadful
            reality in the sensitivity of all by every visual and verbal
            means?
            Instead of vaguely evoking a debt that someone this
            very morning paid society, would it not be a more effective
            example to remind each taxpayer in detail of what
            he may expect? Instead of sayinz: "If you kill, you will
            atone for it on the scaffold," wouldn't it be better to tell
            him, for purposes of example: "If you kill, you~i1l be
            imprisoned for months or years, tom between an I?Ip0Ssible

            you, tie your hands behind your back, cut with scissors
            your shirt collar and your hair if need be. Perfectionists
            that we are, we shall bind your arms with a strap so that
            you are forced to stoop and your neck will be more accessible.

            one of the executioners will finally seize you by the seat
            of your pants and throw you horizontally on a board

            third will let fall from at height of seven feet a hundredand-
            twenty-pound blade that will slice off your head like
            a razor."
            For the example to be even better, for the terror to
            press each of us sufficiently to outweigh at the right
            ment an irresistible desire for murder, it would be es!.en,oa
            to go still further. Instead of boasting, with the
            tious thoughtlessness characteristic of us, of
            invented this rapid and humanel method of killing
            demned men, we should publish thousands of copies

            schools and universities. Particularly suitable for
            purpose the recent report to the Academy of lVlc~OlClDle
            made by Doctors Piedelic'::vre and Fournier. Those
            rageous doctors, invited in the interest of science to
            amine the bodies of the guillotined after the ex~:CU:ti0I1;
            considered it their duty to sum up their dreadful ()h,<pr'\Tl'>-':;
            tions: "If we may be permitted to give our opinion, such
            sights are frightfully painful. The blood Rows from
            blood vessels at the speed of the severed carotids, then
            coagulates. The muscles contract and their fibrillation is
            stupefying; the intestines ripple and the heart moves ir- ,
            regularly, incompletely, fascinatingly. The mouth puckers
            at certain moments in a terrible pout. It is true that,
            in that severed head the eyes are motionless with dilated,
            pupils; fortunately they look at nothing and, if they are
            devoid of the cloudiness and opalescence of the corpse,
            they have no motion; their transparence belongs to life,
            but their fixity belongs to deaili. All this can last minutes,
            even hours, in sound specimens: death is not immediate.
            . . . Thus, every vital element survives decapitation.
            The doctor is left with this impression of a horrible
            experience, of a murderous vivisection, followed by a
            premature burial." 2
            I doubt that there are many readers who can read that
            terrifying report without blanching. Consequently, its

            exemplary power and its capacity to intimidate can be
            counted on. There is no reason not to add to it eyewitness
            accounts that confirm the doctors' observations. Charlotte
            Corday's severed head blushed, it is said, under the
            executioner's slap. This will not shock anyone who listens
            to more recent observers. An executioner's assistant
            (hence hardly suspect of indulging in romanticizing
            and sentimentality) describes in these terms what he
            was forced to see: "It was a madman undergoing a real
            attack of delirium tremens that we dropped under the
            blade. The head dies at once. But the body literally
            jumps about in the basket, straining on the cords.

            ing." 3 The present chaplain of the Sante prison, Father
            Devoyod (who does not seem opposed to capital punishment),
            gives in his book, Les Delinquants,4 an account
            that goes rather far and renews the story of Languille,
            whose decapitated head answered the call of his name:tS
            "The morning of the execution, the condemned man
            was in a very bad mood and refused the consolations of
            religion. Knowing his heart of hearts and the affection
            he had for his wife, who was very devout, we said to him:
            'Come now, out of love for your wife, commune with
            yourself a moment before dying,' and the condemned
            man accepted. He communed at length before the crucifix,
            then he seemed toO pay no further attention to our
            presence. When he was executed, we were a short distance
            from him. His head fell into the trough in front of
            the guillotine and the body was immediately put into the
            basket; but, by some mistake, the basket was closed before
            the head was put in. The assistant who was carrying
            the head had to wait a moment until the basket was
            opened again; now, during that brief space of time we
            could see the condemned man's eyes fixed on me with a

            we made the sign of the cross to bless the head, and then

            I could adduce other first-hand accounts that would be
            just as hallucinating. But I, for one, could not go on.
            After all, I do not claim that capital punishment is exemplary,
            and the penalty seems to me just what it is, a crude
            surgery practiced under conditions that leave nothing
            edifying about it. Society, on the other hand, and the
            State, which is not so impressionable, can very well put
            up with such details and, since they extol an example,
            ought to try to get everyone put up with them so that
            no .one will be ignorant of them and the population, terronzed
            once and for all, will become Franciscan one and
            all. Whom do they hope to intimidate, otherwise, by
            that example forever hidden, by the threat of a punishment
            described as easy and swift and easier to bear, after
            all, than cancer, by a penalty submerged in the flowers
            of rhetoric? Certainly not those who are considered respectable
            (some of them are) because they are sleeping
            Jt that hour, and the great example has not been announced
            to them, and they will be eating their toast and
            m~rmala~e at the time of the premature burial, and they
            wIll be mformed of the work of justice, if perchance
            th.ey read t~e newspapers, by an insipid news item that
            WIll melt lIke sugar in their memory. And, yet, those
            peaceful creatures are the ones who provide the largest
            percentage. of h?m.icides. Many. such respectable people
            are pot:nt~al cnnunals. Accordmg to a magistrate, the
            vast maJonty of murderers he had known did not know
            v.:hen sha~ng in the morning that they were going to
            kill later m the day. As an example and for the sake of
            security, it would be wiser, instead of hiding the execution,
            to hold up the severed head in front of all who are
            shaving in the morning.
            Nothing of the sort happens. The State disguises executions
            and keeps silent about these statements and eyewitness
            accounts. Hence it doesn't believe in the exemplary
            value of the penalty, except by tradition and
            because it has never bothered to think about the matter.
            The criminal is killed because this has been done for
            centuries and, besides, he is killed in a way that was set
            at the end of the eighteenth century. Out of habit, people
            will turn to arguments that were used centuries ago,
            even though these arguments must be contradicted by
            measures that the evolution of public sensitivity has
            made inevitable. A law is applied without being thought
            out and the condemned die in the name of a theory in
            which the executioners do not believe. If they believed
            in it, this would be obvious to all. But publicity not only
            arouses sadistic instincts with incalculable repercussions
            eventually leading to another murder; it also runs the
            risk of provoking revolt and disgust in the public opinion.
            It would become harder to execute men one after
            another, as is done in our country today, if those executions
            were translated into vivid images in the popular
            imagination. The man who enjoys his coffee while reading
            that justice has been done would spit it out at the
            least detail. And the texts I have quoted might seem to
            vindicate certain professors of criminal law who, in their
            obvious inability to justify that anachronistic penalty,
            console themselves by declaring, with the sociologist
            Tarde, that it is better to cause death without causing
            suffering than it is to cause suffering without causing
            death. This is why we must approve the position of Gambetta,
            who, as an adversary of the death penalty, voted
            against a bill involving suppression of publicity for executions,
            declaring: "If you suppress the horror of the
            spectacle, if you execute inside prisons, you will
            smother the public outburst of revolt that has taken
            place of late and you will strenlSthen the death penalty."
            Indeed, one must kill publicly or confess that one does.
            not feel authorized to kill. If society justifies the death
            )Jenalty by the necessity of the example, it must justify
            itself by making the publicity necessary. It must show.
            the executioner's hands each time and force everyone to
            look at them-the over-delicate citizens and all those.
            who had any responsibility in bringing the execu .
            into being. Otherwise, society admits that it kills without
            knowing what it is saying or doing. Or else it admits
            that such revolting ceremonies can only excite crime Or
            completely upset opinion. Who could better state this
            than a magistrate at the end of his career, Judge Falco,
            whose brave confession deserves serious reRection: "The
            onl y time in my life when I decided against a commuta- .
            tion of penalty and in favor of execution, I thought that,
            despite my position, I could attend the execution and
            remain utterly impassive. Moreover, the criminal was
            not very interesting: he had tormented his daughter and
            finally thrown her into a well. But, after his execution,
            for weeks and even months, my nights were haunted by
            that recollection .... Like everyone else, I served in
            the war and saw an innocent generation die, but I can
            state that nothing gave me the sort of bad conscience I
            felt in the face of the kind of administrative murder that
            is called capital punishment." 6
            But, after all, why should society believe in that example
            when it does not stop crime, when its effects, if
            they exist, are invisible? To begin with, capital punishment
            could not intimidate the man who doesn't know
            that he is going to kill, who makes up his mind to it in a
            ~ash and commits his crime in a state of frenzy or obsesSIOn,
            nor the man who, going to an appointment to have
            it out with someone, takes along a weapon to friohten
            the faithless one or the opponent and uses it althou~h he
            didn't want to or didn't think he wanted to. In other
            words, it could not intimidate the man who is hurled

            into crime as if into a calamity. This is tantamount to saying
            that it is powerless in the majority of cases. It is only
            fair to point out that in our country capital punishment
            is rarely applied in such cases. But the word "rarely" itself
            makes one shudder.
            Does it frighten at least that race of criminals on whom
            it claims to operate and who live off crime? Nothing is
            less certain. We can read in Koestler that at a time when
            pickpockets were executed in England, other pickpockets
            exercised their talents in the crowd surrounding the
            scaffold where their colleague was being hanged. Statistics
            drawn up at the beginning of the century in England
            show that out of 250 who were hanged, 170 had previously
            attended one or more executions. And in 1886,
            out of 167 condemned men who had gone through the
            Bristol prison, 164 had witnessed at least one execution.
            Such statistics are no longer possible to gather in France
            because of the secrecy surrounding executions. But they
            give cause to think that around my father, the day of that
            execution, there must have been a rather large number
            of future criminals, who did not vomit. The power of
            intimidation reaches only the quiet individuals who are
            not drawn toward crime and has no effect on the hardened
            ones who need to be softened. In Koestler's essay
            and in the detailed studies will be found the most convincing
            facts and figures on this aspect of the subject.
            It cannot be denied, however, that men fear death.
            The privation of life is indeed the supreme penalty and
            ought to excite in them a decisive fear. The fear of death,
            arising from the most obscure depths of the individual,
            ravages him; the instinct to live, when it is threatened,
            panics and struggles in agony. Therefore the legislator
            was right in thinking that his law was based upon one of
            the most mysterious and most powerful incentives of
            human nature. But law is always simpler than nature.
            When law ventures, in the hope of dominating, into the
            dark regions of consciousness, it has little chance of
            being able to simplify the complexity it wants to codify.
            _ ._ ..... _ ................... ","U.1..4JLV.1J..J.'f.t::.
            If fear of death is, indeed, a fact, another fact is
            such fear, however great it may be, has never
            quell human passions. Bacon is right in saying
            there is no passion so weak that it cannot confront
            overpower fear of death. Revenge, love, honor, pain,
            other fear manage to overcome it. How could .
            hatred, jealousy fail to do what love of a person
            country, what a passion for freedom manage to do?
            centuries the death penalty, often accompanied by
            barous refinements, has been trying to hold crime
            check; yet crime persists. Why? Because the InstIllctS:
            that are warring in man are not, as the law claims,
            stant forces in a state of equilibrium. They are
            forces constantly waxing and waning, and their repeated
            lapses from equilibrium nourish the life of the mind
            electrical oscillations, when close enough, set up a
            rent. Just imagine the series of oscillations, from .
            to lack of appetite, from decision to renunciation,
            through which each of us passes in a single day, multiply
            these variations infinitely, and you will have an idea.
            of psychological proliferation. Such lapses from equilib- .
            rium are generally too fleeting to allow a single force to
            dominate the whole being. But it may happen that one
            of the soul's forces breaks loose until it fills the whole
            field of consciousness; at such a moment no instinct, not
            even that of life, can oppose the tyranny of that irresistible
            force. For capital punishment to be really intimidating,
            human nature would have to be different; it would
            have to be as stable and serene as the law itself. But then
            human nature would be dead.
            It is not dead. This is why, however surprising this
            may seem to anyone who has never observed or directly
            experienced human complexity, the murderer, most of
            the time, feels innocent when he kills. Every criminal
            acquits himself before he is judged. He considers himself,
            if not within his right, at least excused by circumstances.
            He does not think or foresee; when he thinks,
            it is to foresee that he will be forgiven altogether or in
            REFLECTIONS ON THE GUILLOTINE
            part. How could he fear what he considers highly improbable?
            He will fear death after the ver?ic.t ~ut .not
            before the crime. Hence the law, to be mtlmldatmg,
            should leave the murderer no chance, should be implacable
            in advance and particularly admit no extenuati~g
            circumstance. But who among us would dare ask thIS?
            If anyone did, it would still be necessary to ta~e i.nto
            account another paradox of human nature. If the mstII;-ct
            to live is fundamental, it is no more so than another mstinct
            of which the academic psychologists do not speak:
            the death instinct, which at certain moments calls for
            the destruction of oneself and of others. It is probable
            iliat the desire to kill often coincides with the desire to
            die or to annihilate oneself.7 Thus, the instinct for selfpreservation
            is matched, in variable proportions, by the
            instinct for destruction. The latter is the only way of
            explaining altogether the vario~s p~rversions. which,
            from alcoholism to drugs, lead an mdIVIdual to hIS death
            while he knows full well what is happening. Man wants
            to live, but it is useless to hope that this desire will dictate
            all his actions. He aJ.so wants to be nothing; he wants
            the irreparable, and death for its own sake. So it happens
            that the criminal wants not only the crime but the suffering
            that goes with it, even (one might say, especially). if
            that suffering is exceptional. When that odd deSIre
            grows and becomes dominant, ilie prospect of being put
            to deaili not only fails to stop ilie criminal, but probably
            even adds to the vertigo in which he swoons. Thus, in a
            way, he kills in order to me.
            Such peculiarities suffice to explain why a penalty
            that seems calculated to frighten nonnal minds is in reality
            altogilier unrelated to ordinary psychology. All
            statistics without exception, those concerning countries
            that have abolished execution as well as the others, show
            that there is no connection between the abolition of the

            of those crimes. For centuries now, those crimes have no
            longer b~en punished with death. Yet they have not increased;
            m fact, some :>f them. have decreased. Similarly,
            murder has been pumshed WIth execution for centuries
            and ye~ the race of ~ain has not disappeared. Finally, inthe
            thIrty-three natIons that have abolished the death
            penalty or no longer use it, the number of murders has
            not ~ncrease~. Who .co~l~ deduce from this that capital
            pumshment IS really IntImIdating?
            C?nservatives cannot deny these facts or these figures.
            TheIr only ?nd fin?! reply is significant. They explain
            t~e paradoXIcal attItude of a society that so carefully
            ~1!des the ex~cution~, it claims to be exemplary. "NothIng
            proves, Indeed, say the conservatives "that the
            death penalty is exemplary; as a matter of f;ct it is certain

            at.ed. by it. But there is no way of knowing those it has
            IntImIdated; consequently, nothing proves that it is not
            exemplary." Thus, the greatest of punishments, the one
            that Involves the last dishonor for the condemned and
            grants the supreme privilege to society, rests on nothing
            but an un~enfIable possibility. Death, on the other hand,
            does not Involve degrees or probabilities. It solidifies
            all things, culpability and the body, in a definitive

            ~nghsh Roy~l. Commission that recently resumed the study:
            .All the stanstlcs we have examined confirm the fact that abolinon
            of the death penalty has not provoked an increase in the
            number of crimes."
            REFLECTIONS ON THE GUILLOTINE
            rigidity. Yet it is administered among us in the name of
            chan(re and a calculation. Even if that calculation were
            reasonable, should there not be a certainty to authorize
            the most certain of deaths? However, the condemned is
            cut in two, not so much for the crime he committed but
            by virtue of all the crimes that might have been and
            were not committed, that can be and will not be committed.
            The most sweeping uncertainty in this case authorizes
            the most implacable certainty.
            I am not the only one to be amazed by such a dangerous
            contradiction. Even the State condemns it, and such
            bad conscience explains in turn the contradiction of its
            own attitude. The State divests its executions of all publicity
            because it cannot assert, in the face of facts, that
            they ever served to intimidate criminals. The State cannot
            escape the dilemma Beccaria described when he
            wrote: "If it is important to give the people proofs of
            power often, then executions must be frequent; but
            crimes will have to be frequent too, and this will prove
            that the death penalty does not make the complete impression
            that it should, whence it results that it is both
            useless and necessary." What can the State do with a
            penalty that is useless and necessary, except to hide it
            without abolishing it? The State will keep it then, a little
            out of the way, not without embarrassment, in the
            blind hope that one man at least, one day at least, will
            be stopped from his murderous gesture by thought of
            the punishment and, without anyone's ever lmowing it,
            will justify a law that has neither reason nor experience
            in its favor. In order to continue claiming that the guillotine
            is exemplary, the State is consequently led to multiply
            very real murders in the hope of avoiding a possible
            murder which, as far as it knows or ever will know, may
            never be perpetrated. An odd law, to be sure, which
            knows the murder it commits and will never know the
            one it prevents.
            What will be left of that power of example if it is
            proved that capital punishment has another power, and
            a very real one, which degrades men to the point of
            sbame, madness, and murder?
            It is already possible to follow the exemplary effects of
            such ceremonies on public opinion, the manifestations
            o~ s~dism ~ey ~ro~se, the hideous vainglory they excite
            III certam cnn:mals. No nobility in the vicinity of
            the gallows, but dIsgust, contempt, or the vilest indulgence
            of the senses. These effects are well known. Decency
            forced the guillotine to emigrate from Place de
            l'Hotel de Vi}le to the city gates, then into the prisons. :v e . ar.e less mformed as to the feelings of those whose
            Job It IS to attend such spectacles. Just listen then to the
            warden of an English prison who confesses to "a keen
            sense of personal shame" and to the chaplain who speaks
            of "?orror, shame, and humiliation." 9 Just imagaine the
            feelIngs of the man who kills under orders-I mean the
            executioner. What can we think of those officials who
            caU the guillotine "the shunting en!!ine," the conde
            mned man "th e cleln'"t or "the parc0 e1? " The priest
            Bela Just, who accompanied more than thirty condemned
            men, writes: "The slang of the administrators
            of justice is quite as cynical and vulgar as that of the
            criminals." 1 And here are the remarks of one of our assistant
            executioners on his journeys to the provinces:
            'When we would start on a trip, it was always a lark
            with taxis and the best restaurants part of the spree!" ~
            The same one says, boasting of the executioner's skill
            in releasing the blade: "You could allow yourself the
            fun of pulling the client's hair." The dissoluteness expressed
            here has other, deeper aspects. The clothinO' of
            the condemned belongs in principle to the executio~er.
            The elder Deibler used to hang all such articles of

            clothing in a shed and now and then would go and look
            at them. But there are more serious aspects. Here is
            what our assistant executioner declares: 'The new executioner
            is batty about the guillotine. He sometimes
            spends days on end at home sitting on a chair, ready
            with hat and coat on, waiting for a summons from the
            Ministry." 3
            Yes, this is the man of whom Joseph de Maistre said
            that, for him to exist, there had to be a special decree
            from the divirIe power and that, without him, "order
            yields to chaos, thrones collapse, and society disappears."
            This is the man through whom SOciety rids itself altogether
            of the guilty man, for the executioner signs the
            prison release and takes charge of a free man. The line
            and solemn example, thought up by our legislators, at
            least produces one sure effect-to depreciate or to destroy
            all humanity and reason in those who take part in it directly.
            But, it will be said, these are exceptional creatures
            who find a vocation in such disbonor. They seem less exceptional
            when we learn that hundreds of persons offer
            to serve as executioners without pay. The men of our
            generation, who have lived through the history of recent
            years, will not be astonished by this bit of information.
            They know that behind the most peaceful and familiar
            faces slumbers the impulse to torture and murder. The
            punishment that aims to intimidate an unknown murderer
            certainly confers a vocation of killer on many another
            monster about whom there is no doubt. And since
            we are busy justifying our cruelest laws with probable
            considerations, let there be no doubt that out of those
            hundreds of men whose services were declined, one at
            least must have satisfied otherwise the bloodthirsty instincts
            the guillotine excited in him.
            If, therefore, there is a desire to maintain the death
            penalty, let us at least be spared the hypocrisy of a justia
            Ibid.
            fication by example. Let us be frank about that penalty
            which can have no publicity, that intimidation which
            works only on respectable people, so long as they are respectable,
            which fascinates those who have ceased to be respectable
            and debases or deranges those who take part
            in it. It is a penalty, to be sure, a frightful torture, both
            physical and moral, but it provides no sure example except
            a demoralizing one. It punishes, but it forestalls
            nothing; indeed, it may even arouse the impulse to murder.
            It hardly seems to exist, except for the man who
            suffers it-in his soul for months and years, in his body
            during the desperate and violent hour when he is cut in
            two without suppressing his life. Let us call it by the
            name which, for lack of any other nobility, will at least
            give the nobility of truth, and let us recognize it for
            what it is essentially; a revenge.
            A punishment that penalizes without forestalling is indeed
            called revenge. It is a quasi-arithmetical reply made
            by society to whoever breaks its primordial law. That
            reply is as old as man; it is called the law of retaliation.
            Whoever has done me harm must suffer harm; whoever
            has put out my eye must lose an eye; and whoever has
            k~lled must die. This is an emotion, and a particularly
            vlOlent one, not a principle. Retaliation is related to nature
            and instinct, not to law. Law, by definition, cannot
            obey the same rules as nature. If murder is in the nature
            of man, the law is not intended to imitate or reproduce
            that nature. It is intended to correct it. Now, retaliation
            does no more than ratify and confer the status of a law
            on a pure impulse of nature. We have a11 known that
            ~mpulse, often to our shame, and we know its power, for
            It comes down to us from the primitive forests. In this
            :egard, we. Fr~nch,. who are properly indignant upon seemg
            the 011 kmg III Saudi Arabia preach international
            democracy and call in a butcher to cut off a thief's hand
            with a cleaver, live also in a sort of Middle Ages without
            even the consolations of faith. We still define justice according
            to the rules of a crude arithmetic.4 C~n i~ be said
            at least that that arithmetic is exact and that JustIce, even
            when elementary, even when limited to legal revenge, is
            safeguarded by the death penalty? The answer must be
            no.
            Let us leave aside the fact that the law of retaliation is
            inapplicable and that it would seem just as excessive t?
            punish the incendiary by setting fire to his house as It
            would be insufficient to punish the thief by deducting
            from his bank account a sum equal to his theft. Let us
            admit that it is just and necessary to compensate for the
            murder of the victim by the death of the murderer. But
            beheading is not simply death. It is just as different, in
            essence, from the privation of life as a concentration
            camp is from prison. It is a murder, to be sure, and one
            that arithmetically pays for the murder committed. But
            it adds to death a rule, a public premeditation known to
            the future victim, an organization, in short, which is in
            itself a source of moral sufferings more terrible than
            death. Hence there is no equivalence. Many laws consider
            a premeditated crime more serious than a crime of
            pure violence. But what then is capital punishment but
            the most premeditated of murders, to which nO criminal's
            deed, however calculated it may be, can be compared?
            For there to be equivalence, the death penalty would
            have to punish a criminal who had warned his victim of
            4 A few years ago I asked for the reprieve of six Tunisians who
            had been condemned to death for the murder, in a riot, of three
            French policemen. The circumstances in which the murder had
            taken place made difficult any division of responsibilities. A
            note from the executive office of the President of the Republic
            informed me that my appeal was being considered by the appropriate
            organization. Unfortunately, when that note was addressed
            to me I had already read two weeks earlier that the sentence
            had been carried out. Three of the condemned men had
            been put to death and the three others reprieved. The reasons
            for reprieving some rather than the others were not convincing.
            But probably it was essential to carry out three executions where
            there had been three victims.
            the date at which he would inBict a horrible deatl1 on
            him and who, from that moment onward, had confined
            him at his mercy for months. Such a monster is not encountered
            in private life.
            There, too, when our official jurists talk of putting to
            death without causing suffering, they don't know what
            they are talking about and, above all, they lack imagination.
            The devastating, degrading fear that is imposed on
            the condemned for months or years5 is a punishment
            more terrible than death, and one that was not imposed
            on the victim. Even in the fright caused by the mortal
            violence being done to him, most of the time the victim
            is hastened to his death without knowing what is happening
            to him. The period of horror is counted out with
            his life, and hope of escaping the madness that has
            swept down upon that life probably never leaves him.
            On the other hand, the horror is parceled out to the man
            who is condemned to death. Torture through hope alternates
            with the pangs of animal despair. The lawyer and
            chaplain, out of mere humanity, and the jailers, so that
            the condemned man will keep quiet, are unanimous in
            4ssuring him that he will be reprieved. He believes this
            with all his being and then he ceases to believe it. He
            hopes by day and despairs of it by night.6 As the weeks
            pass, hope and despair increase and become equally unbearable.
            According to all accounts, the color of the skin
            changes, fear acting like an acid. "Knowing that you are
            5 Roemen, condemned to death at the Liberation of France, remained
            seven hundred days in chains before being executed,
            and this is scandalous. Those condemned under common law,
            as a general rule, wait from three to six months for the morning
            of their death. And it is difficult, if one wants to maintain their
            chances of survival, to shorten that period. I can bear witness,
            moreover, to the fact that the examination of appeals for mercy
            is conducted in France with a seriousness that does not exclude
            the visible inclination to pardon, insofar as the law and customs
            yennit.

            REFLECTIONS ON THE GUILLOTINE 153
            going to die is nothing," said a condemned man in Fresnes.
            "But not knowing whether or not you are going to
            live, that's terror and anguish." Cartouche said of the
            supreme punishment: 'Why, it's just a few minutes that
            have to be lived through." But it is a matter of months,
            not of minutes. Long in advance the condemned man
            knows that he is going to be killed and that the only
            thing that can save him is a reprieve, rather similar, for
            him, to the decrees of heaven. In any case, he cannot
            intervene, make a plea himself, or convince. Everything
            goes on outside of him. He is no longer a man but a
            thing waiting to be handled by the executioners. He is
            kept as if he were inert matter, but he still has a consciousness
            which is his chief enemy.
            When the officials whose job it is to kill that man call
            him a parcel, they know what they are saying. To be unable
            to do anything against the hand that moves you
            from one place to another, holds you or rejects you, is
            this not indeed being a parcel, or a thing, or, better, a
            hobbled animal? Even then an animal can refuse to eat.
            The condemned man cannot. He is given the benefit of a
            special diet (at Fresnes, Diet No. 4 with extra milk,
            wine, sugar, jam, butter); they see to it that he nourishes
            himself. If need be, he is forced to do so. The animal
            that is going to be killed must be in the best condition.
            The thing or the animal has a right only to those debased
            freedoms that are called whims. 'They are very
            touchy," a top-sergeant at Fresnes says without the least
            irony of those condemned to death. Of course, but how
            else can they have contact with freedom and the dignity
            of the will that man cannot do without? Touchy or not,
            the moment the sentence has been pronounced the condemned
            man enters an imperturbable machine. For a
            certain number of weeks he travels along in the intricate
            machinery that determines his every gesture and eventually
            hands him over to those who will lay him down on
            the killing machine. The parcel is no longer subject to
            the laws of chance that hang over the living creature but
            to mechanical laws that allow him to foresee accurately
            the day of his beheading.
            That day his being an object comes to an end. During
            the three quarters of an hour separating him from the
            end, the certainty of a powerless death stifles everything
            else; the animal, tied down and amenable, knows a hell
            that makes the hell he is threatened with seem ridiculous.
            The Greeks, after all, were more humane with their
            hemlock. They left their condemned a relative freedom,
            the possibility of putting off or hastening the hour of his
            death. They gave him a choice between suicide and execution.
            On the other hand, in order to be doubly sure,
            we deal with the culprit ourselves. But there could not
            really be any justice unless the condemned, after making
            known his decision months in advance, had approached
            his victim, bound him firmly, informed him
            that he would be put to death in an hour, and had
            finally used that hour to set up the apparatus of death.
            What criminal ever reduced his victim to such a desperate
            and powerless condition?
            This doubtless explains the odd submissiveness that is
            customary in the condemned at the moment of their execution.
            These men who have nothinO" more to lose
            could play their last card, choose to die ~f a chance bullet
            or be guillotined in the kind of frantic struggle that
            dulls all the faculties. In a way, this would amount to
            dying freely. And yet, with but few exceptions, the rule
            is for the condemned to walk toward death passively in a
            sort of dreary despondency. That is pr0bably what our
            journalists mean when they say that the condemned died
            courageously. We must read between the lines that the
            condemned made no noise, accepted his status as a parcel,
            and that everyone is grateful to him for this. In such
            a degrading business, the interested party shows a praiseworthy
            ~nse of propriety by keeping the degradation
            from lastmg too long. But the compliments and the certificates
            of courage belong to the general mystification
            .Iilil'LECTIONS ON THE GUILLOl'INIl
            surrounding the death penalty. For the condemned will
            often be seemly in proportion to the fear he feels. He
            will deserve the praise of the press only if his fear or his
            feeling of isolation is great enough to sterilize him completely.
            Let there be no misunderstanding. Some among
            the condemned, whether political or not, die heroically,
            and they must be granted the proper admiration and respect.
            But the majority of them know only the silence of
            fear, only the impassivity of fright, and it seems to me
            that such terrined silence deserves even greater respect.
            When the priest Bela Just offers to write to the family of
            a young condemned man a few moments before he is
            hanged and hears the reply: "I have no courage, even for
            that," how can a priest, hearing that confession of weakness,
            fail to honor the most wretched and most sacred
            thing in man? Those who say nothing but leave a little
            pool on the spot from which they are taken-who would
            dare say they died as co-wards? And how can we describe
            the men who reduced them to such cowardice? After all,
            every murderer when he kills runs the risk of the most
            dreadful of deaths, whereas those who kill him risk nothing
            except advancement.
            No, what man experiences at such times is beyond an
            morality. Not virtue, nor courage, nor intelligence, nor
            even innocence has anything to do with it. Society is
            suddenly reduced to a state of primitive terrors where
            nothing can be judged. All equity and all dignity have
            disappeared. 'The conviction of innocence does not immunize
            against brutal treatment. . . . I have seen authentic
            bandits die courageously whereas innocent men
            went to their deaths trembling in every muscle." 7 When
            the same man adds that, according to his experience, intellectuals
            show more weakness, he is not implying that
            such men have less courage than others but merely that
            they have more imagination. Having to face an inevitable

            of the. ~ondemned man, bound and up against the
            publIc coalItIOn that demands his death, is in itself an
            ~nimaginable punishment. From this point of view, too,
            It wo~ld be better for the execution to be public. The
            actor m every man could then come to the aid of the
            terrified animal and help him cut a figure, even in his
            own eye:. But darkness and secrecy offer no recourse. In
            such, a dIsaster, courage, strength of soul, even faith may
            be ,d:sadvantag~s. As a ~eneral rule, a man is undone by
            waItmg for capItal pumshment well before he dies. Two
            deaths are inflicted on him, the first being worse than the
            second, whereas he killed but once. Compared to such
            torture, the penalty of retaliation seems like a civilized
            law. It never claimed that the man who gouged out one
            of his brothers eyes should be totally blinded.
            Such a basic injustice has repercussions, besides, on the
            relatives of the executed man. The victim 11as his family
            whose sufferings are generally very great and who, mos~
            often, want to be avenged. They are, but the relatives of
            the cond:mned man then discover an excess of suffering
            that pumshes them beyond all justice. A mothers or a

            are all tortures that were not imposed on the relatives of

            they c~nnot want the revenge to extend so far beyond
            the cnme and to torture people who share their own

            and I was told Wednesday as I came back from the
            visiting-room. I immediately informed Papa and Mama,
            who had not yet left the prison. You can imagine their
            happiness. 9 We can indeed imagine it, but only insofar
            as we can imagine their uninterrupted suffering until the
            moment of the reprieve, and the final despair of those
            who receive the other notification, which punishes, in
            iniquity, their innocence and their misfortune.
            To cut short this question of the law of retaliation, we
            must note that even in its primitive form it can operate
            only between two individuals of whom one is absolutely
            innocent and the other absolutely guilty. The victim, to
            be sure, is innocent. But can the society that is supposed
            to represent the victim lay claim to innocence? Is it not
            responsible, at least in part, for the crime it punishes so
            severely? This theme has often been developed, and I
            shall not repeat the arguments that all sorts of thinkers
            have brought forth since the eighteenth century. They
            can be summed lip anyway by saying that every society
            has the criminals it deserves. But insofar as France il'>
            concerned, it is impossible not to point out the circumstances
            that ought to make our legislators more modest.
            Answering an inquiry of the Figaro in 1952 on the
            death penalty, a colonel asserted that establishing hard
            labor for life as the most severe penalty would amount
            to setting up schools of crime. That high-ranking officer
            seemed to be ignorant, and I can only congratulate him.
            of the fact that we already have our schools of crime.
            which differ from our federal prisons in this notable regard:
            it is possible to leave them at any hour of the day
            or night; they are the taverns and slums, the glory of our
            Republic. On this point it is impossible to express oneself
            moderately.

            To be sure, the killer of children is a particularly vile
            creature who scarcely arouses pity. It is probable, too Cl
            say probable), that none of my readers, forced to live in
            the same conditions, would go so far as to kill children.
            Hence there is no question of reducing the culpability
            of certain monsters. But those monsters, in decent dwellings,
            would perhaps have had no occasion to go so far.
            The least that can be said is that they are not alone
            guilty, and it seems strange that the right to punish them
            should be granted to the very people who subsidize, not
            housing, but the growing of beets for the production of
            alcohoP
            But alcohol makes this scandal even more shocking. It
            is known that the French nation is systematically intoxicated
            by its parliamentary majority, for generally vile reasons.
            Now, the proportion of alcohol's responsibility in
            the cause of bloodthirsty crimes is shocking. A lawyer
            (Maltre Guillon) estimated it at 60 per cent. For Dr.
            Lagriffe the proportion extends from 41.7 to 72 per cent.
            An investigation carried out in 1951 in the clearingcenter
            of the Fresnes prison, among the common-law
            criminals, showed 29 per cent to be chronic alcoholics
            and 24 per cent to have an alcoholic inheritance. FinaIIy,
            95 per cent of the killers of children are alcoholics.
            These are impressive figures. We can balance them with
            an even more magnificent figure: the tax report of a firm
            producing aperitifs, which in 1953 showed a profit of
            410 million francs. Comparison of these figures justifies
            informing the stockholders of that firm and the Deputies
            with a financial interest in alcohol that they have certainly
            killed more children than they think. As an opponent
            of capital punishment, I am far from asking that
            they be condemned to death. But, to begin with, it
            strikes me as indispensable and urgent to take them under
            military escort to the next execution of a murderer of
            1 France ranks first among countries for its consumption of alcohol

            The State that sows alcohol cannot be surpnsed to
            reap crime.2 Instead of showing. surprise, it simply
            goes on cutting off heads into whIch It has poured so
            much alcohol. It metes out justice imperturbably and
            poses as a creditor: its good conscience ~oes not suffer at
            all. Witness the alcohol salesman who, m answer to the
            Figaro's inquiry, exclaimed: "I know just wh.at the
            staunchest enemy of the death penalty would do If, h~vivg

            But if he were to follow through his thinking and the
            aforementioned assassins reeked of alcohol, he would
            then go and take care of those whose .vocation. ~s to intoxicate

            the relatives of victims of alcoholic crimes have never
            thought of getting some enlightenment from the Parliament.
            Yet nothing of the sort takes place, and the Stat~,
            enjoying general confidence, even supported by publIc
            opinion, goes on chastising assassins (p~rticularly. the alcoholics)

            accompanies only crimes of violence, which are not punished
            with death, whereas the chronic alcoholic is capable
            also of premeditated crimes, which will bring about
            his death. Consequently, the State reserves the right to
            punish in the only case in which it has a real responsibility.
            Does this amount to saying that every alcoholic must
            he declared irresponsible by a State that will beat its
            breast until the nation drinks nothing but fruit juice?
            Certainly not. No more than that the reasons based on
            heredity should cancel an culpability. The real responsibility
            of an offender cannot be precisely measured. We
            know that arithmetic is incapable of adding up the number
            of our antecedents, whether alcoholic or not. Going
            back to the beginning of time, the figure would be
            twenty-two times, raised to the tenth power, greater than
            the number of present inhabitants of the earth. The number
            of bad or morbid predispositions our antecedents
            have been able to transmit to us is, thus, incalculable.
            We come into the world laden with the weight of an infinite
            necessity. One would have to grant us, therefore,
            a general irresponsibility. Logic would demand that neither
            punishment nor reward should ever be meted out,
            and, by the same token, all society would become impossible.
            The instinct of preservation of societies, and hence
            of individuals, requires instead that individual responsibility
            be postulated and accepted without dreaming of an
            absolute indulgence that would amount to the death of
            all SOciety. But the same reasoning must lead us to conclude
            that there never exists any total responsibility or,
            consequently, any absolute punishment or reward. No
            one can be rewarded completely, not even the winners of
            Nobel Prizes. But no one should be punished absolutely
            if he is thought guilty, and certainly not if there is a
            chance of his being innocent. The death penalty, which
            really neither provides an example nor assures distributive
            justice, simply usurps an exorbitant privilege by
            REFLECTIONS ON '!'HI! GUILLOTINl! 161
            claiming to punish an always relative culpability by a
            definitive and irreparable punishment.
            H indeed capital punishment represents a doubtful example
            and an unsatisfactory justice, we must agree with
            its defenders that it is eliminative. The death penalty
            definitively eliminates the condemned man. That alone,
            to tell the truth, ought to exclude, for its partisans especially,
            the repetition of risky arguments which, as we
            have just seen, can always be contested. Instead, one
            might frankly say that it is definitive because it must be,
            and affirm that certain men are irremediable in society,
            that they constitute a permanent danger for every citizen
            and for the social order, and that therefore, before anything
            else, they must be suppressed. No one, in any case,
            can refute the existence in society of certain wild animals
            whose energy and brutality nothing seems capable
            of breaking. The death penalty, to be sure, does not
            solve the problem they create. Let us agree, at least, that
            it suppresses the problem.
            I shall come back to such men. But is capital punishment
            applied only to them? Is there any assurance that
            none of those executed is remediable? Can it even be
            asserted that none of them is innocent? In both cases,
            must it not be admitted that capital punishment is eliminative
            only insofar as it is irreparable? The 15th of
            March, 1957, Burton Abbott was executed in California,
            condemned to death for having murdered a little girl of
            fourteen. Men who commit such a heinous crime are, I
            believe, classified among the irremediable. Although Abbott
            continually protested his innocence, he was condemned.
            His execution had been set for the 15th of
            March at ten d clock. At 9: loa delay was granted to allow
            his attorneys to make a final appeaf.3 At eleven

            o'clock the appeal was refused. At I I : I 5 Abbott entered
            the gas chamber. At I I : 18 he breathed in the first whiffs
            of gas. At I I : 20 the secretary of the Committee on Reprieves
            called on the telephone. The Committee had
            changed its mind. They had tried to reach the Governor,
            who was out sailing; then they had phoned the prison
            directly. Abbott was taken from the gas chamber. It was
            too late. If only it had been cloudy over California that
            day, the Governor would not have gone out sailing. He
            would have telephoned two minutes earlier; today Abbott
            would be alive and would perhaps see his innocence
            proved. Any other penalty, even the harshest, would
            have left him that chance. The death penalty left him
            none.
            This case is exceptional, some will say. Our lives are
            exceptional, too, and yet, in the fleeting existence that is
            ours, this takes place near us, at some ten hours' distance
            by air. Abbott's misfortune is less an exception than a
            news item like so many others, a mistake that is not isolated
            if we can believe our newspapers (see the Deshays
            case, to cite but the most recent one). The jurist Olivecroix,
            applying the law of probability to the chance of
            judicial error, around 186o, concluded that perhaps one
            innocent man was condemned in every two hundred and
            fifty-seven cases. The proportion is small? It is small in
            relation to average penalties. It is infinite in relation to
            capital punishment. When Hugo writes that to him the
            name of the guillotine is Lesurques,4 he does not mean
            that all those who are decapitated are Lesurques, but that
            one Lesurques is enough for the guillotine to be permanently
            dishonored. It is understandable that Belgium gave
            up once and for all pronouncing the death penalty after a
            judi:i~l error and that England raised the question of
            abolItIOn after the Hayes case. It is also possible to understand
            the conclusions of the Attorney General who, when .
            consulted as to the appeal of a very probably guilty crim-
            ~ This is the name of the innocent man guillotined in the case
            of the Courrier de Lyon.
            inal whose victim had not been found, wrote: 'The survival
            of X . . . gives the authorities the possibility of examining
            at leisure any new clue that might eventually be
            brought in as to the existence of his wife.5 â€¢â€¢â€¢ On the
            other hand, the execution, by canceling that hypothetical
            possibility of examination, would, I fear, give to the slightest
            clue a theoretical value, a power of regret that I think
            it inopportune to create." A love of justice and truth is expressed
            here in a most moving way, and it would be appropriate
            to quote often in our courts that "power of regret"
            which so vividly sums up the danger that faces every juror.
            Once the innocent man is dead, no one can do anything
            for him, in fact, but to rehabilitate him, if there is stilI
            someone to ask for this. Then he is given back his innocence,
            which, to tell the truth, he had never lost. But the
            persecution of which he was a victim, his dreadful sufferings,
            his horrible death have been given him forever. It
            remains only to think of the innocent men of the future,
            so that these tortures may be spared them. This was done

            Probably the French take comfort from the idea that
            justice has progressed hand in hand with science. When
            the learned expert holds forth in court, it seems as if a
            priest has spoken, and the jury, raised in the religion of
            science, expresses its opinion. However, recent cases,
            chief among them the Besnard case, have shown us whal
            a comedy of experts is like. Culpability is no better established
            for having been established in a test tube,
            even a graduated one. A second test tube will tell a different
            story, and the personal equation loses none of its
            importance in such dangerous mathematics. The proportion
            of learned men who are really experts is the same
            as that of judges who are psychologists, hardly any
            greater than that of serious and objective juries. Today,
            as yesterday, the chance of error remains. Tomorrow an-

            of chance enters into any sentence. The look of
            the accused, his antecedents (adultery is often looked
            upon as an aggravating circumstance by jurors who may
            or may not all have been always faithful), his manner
            (which is in his favor only if it is conventional-in other
            words, play-acting most of the time), his very elocution
            (the old hands know that one must neither stammer
            nor be too eloquent), the mishaps of the trial enjoyed in
            a sentimental key (and the truth, alas, is not always
            emotionally effective): so many flukes that influence the
            final decision of the jury. At the moment of the death
            verdict, one may be sure that to arrive at the most definite
            of penalties, an extraordinary combination of uncertainties
            was necessary. When it is known that the supreme
            verdict depends on the jury's evaluation of the
            extenuating circumstances, when it is known, above all,
            that ~he ~eform o~ I832 gave our juries the power of

            are never two comparable juries, the man who is executed

            nist workman who has just been guillotined in Algeria
            for having put a bomb (discovered before it went off) in
            a factory locker room was condemned as much because
            of the general climate as because of what he did. In the
            present state of mind in Algeria, there was a. ~esire at
            one and the same time to prove to the Arab opmlOn that
            the guillotine was designed for Frenchmen too and to
            satisfy the French opinion wrought up by the cri~e~ of
            terrorism. At the same moment, however, the MmIster
            who approved the execution was accepting Communist
            votes in his electoral district. If the circumstances had
            been different, the accused would have got off easy and
            his only risk, once he had become a Deputy of the party,
            would be finding himself having a drink at the same bar
            as the Minister someday. Such thoughts are bitter, and
            one would like them to remain alive in the minds of our
            leaders. They must know that times and customs change;
            a day comes when the guilty man, too rapidly exec~lted,
            does not seem so black. But it is too late and there IS no
            alternative but to repent or to forget. Of course, people
            forget. Nonetheless, society is no less affected. The unpunished
            crime, according to the Greeks, infected the
            whole city. But innocence condemned or crime too severely
            punished, in the long run, soils the city just as
            much. We know this, in France.
            Such, it will be said, is human justice, and, despite its
            imperfections, it is better than arbitrariness. But that
            sad evaluation is bearable only in connection with ordinary
            penalties. It is scandalous in the face of verdicts
            of death. A classic treatise on French law, in order to
            excuse the death penalty for not involving degrees, states
            this: "Human justice has not the slightest desire to as~

            same weakness in which society hnds a sort of permanent
            extenuating circumstance for itself? Can the jury decently
            say: "If.1 kill you by mistake, you will forgive me
            when you consIder the weaknesses of our common nature.
            But I am condemning you to death without considering
            ~ose weaknesses or that nature"? There is a solidarity
            . _ -....... of an men in error and aberration. Must that solidarity
            operate for the tribunal and be denied the accused? I No, and if justice has any meaning in this world,
            it means nothing but the recognition of that solidarity; it
            c~nnot, by its very essence, divorce itself from compasSIOn.
            Compassion, of course, can in this instance be but
            awareness of a commOn suffering and not a frivolous indulgence
            paying no attention to the sufferings and rights
            of the victim. Compassion does not exclude punishment,
            but it suspends the hnal condemnation. Compassion
            loathes the dehnitive, irreparable measure that does an in!
            ustice to mankind as a whole because of failing to take
            mto account the wretchedness of the common condition.
            To tell the truth, certain juries are wen aware of this,
            for they often admit extenuating circumstances in a
            crime that nothing can extenuate. This is because the
            death penalty seems excessive to them in such cases and
            they prefer not punishing enough to punishing too much.
            The extreme severity of the penalty then favors crime inst~
            d of penalizing it. T~ere is not a court session during
            whIch we do not read In the press that a verdict is incoherent

            of this. However, faced with the enormity of capital
            punishment, they prefer, as we too should prefer, to look
            like fools rather than to compromise their nights to come.
            Knowing themselves to be fallible, they at least draw the
            appropriate consequences. And true justice is on their
            side precisely insofar as logic is not.
            There are, however, major criminals whom an juries
            would condemn at any time and in any place whatever.
            Their crimes are not open to doubt, and the evidence
            brought by the accusation is conhrmed by the confessions
            of the defense. Most likely, everything that is abnormal
            and monstrous in them is enough to classify them as
            pathological. But the psychiatric experts, in the majority
            of cases, affirm their responsibility. Recently in Paris a
            young man, somewhat weak in character but kind and
            affectionate, devoted to his family, was, according to his
            own admission, annoyed by a remark his father made
            about his coming home late. The father was sitting reading
            at the dining-room table. The young man seized an
            ax and dealt his father several blows from behind. Then
            in the same way he struck down his mother, who was in
            the kitchen. He undressed, hid his bloodstained trousers
            in the closet, went to make a call on the family of his
            fiancee, without showing any signs, then returned home
            and notihed the police that he had just found his parents
            murdered. The police immediately discovered the bloodstained
            trousers ancli, without difficulty, got a calm confession
            from the parricide. The psychiatrists decided that
            this man who murdered through annoyance was responsible.
            His odd indifference, of which he was to give other
            indications in prison (showing pleasure because his parents'
            funeral had attracted so many people-"They were
            much loved," he told his lawyer), cannot, however, be
            considered as normal. But his reasoning power was apparently
            untouched.
            Many "monsters" offer equally impenetrable exteriors.
            They are eliminated on the mere consideration of the
            facts. Apparently the nature or the magnitude of their
            L
            168 REFLECTIONS ON THE GUILLOTINE
            crimes allows no room for imagining that they can ever
            repent or reform. They must merely be kept from doing
            it again, and there is no other solution but to eliminate
            them. On this frontier, and on it alone, discussion about
            the death penalty is legitimate. In all other cases the arguments
            for capital punishment do not stand up to the
            criticisms of the abolitionists. But in extreme cases, and
            in our state of ignorance, we make a wager. No fact, no
            reasoning can bring together those who think that a
            chance must always be left to the vilest of men and those
            who consider that chance illusory. But it is perhaps possible,
            on that final frontier, to go beyond the long opposition
            between partisans and adversaries of the death
            penalty by weighing the advisability of that penalty today,
            and in Europe. With much less competence, I shall
            try to reply to the wish expressed by a Swiss jurist, Professor
            Jean Graven, who wrote in 1952 in his remarkable
            study on the problem of the death penalty: "Faced with
            the problem that is once more confronting our conscience
            and Our reason, we think that a solution must be sought,
            not through the conceptions, problems, and arguments of
            the past, nor through the hopes and theoretical promises
            of the future, but through the ideas, recognized facts,
            and necessities of the present." 7 It is possible, indeed, to
            debate endlessly as to the benefits or harm attributable
            to the death penalty through the ages or in an intellectual
            vacuum. But it plays a role here and now, and we
            must take our stand here and nOw in relation to the
            modem executioner. What does the death penalty mean
            to the men of the mid-century?
            To simplify matters, let us say that our civilization has
            lost the only values that, in a certain way, can justify
            that penalty and, on the other hand, suffers from evils
            that necessitate its suppression. In other words, the abolition
            of the death penalty ought to be asked for by all

            thinking members of our society, for reasons both of
            logic and of realism.
            Of lOgiC, to begin with. Deciding that a man must
            have the definitive punishment imposed on him is tantamount
            to deciding that that man has no chance of making
            amends. This is the point, to repeat ourselves, where
            the arguments clash blindly and crystallize in a sterile
            opposition. But it so happens that none among us can
            settle the question, for we are all both judges and interested
            parties. Whence our uncertainty as to our right to
            kill and our inability to convince each other. W'ith@!
            absolute innocence, there is no supreme judge. Now, we
            havearr-aone-wrongll'i-ouY-Hverevenlftliat wrong,
            without falling within the jurisdiction of the laws, went
            as far as the unknown crime. There are no just peoplemerely
            hearts more or less lacking in justice. Living at
            least allows us to discover this and to add to the sum of
            our actions a little of the good that will make up in part
            for the evil we have added to the world. Such a right to
            live, which allows a chance to make amends, is the natural
            right of every man, even the worst man. The lowest
            of criminals and the most upright of judges meet side by
            side, equally wretched in their solidarity. Without that
            right, moral life is utterly impossible. None among us is
            authorized to despair of a single man, except after his
            death, which transforms his life into destiny and then
            permits a definitive judgment. But pronouncing the definitive
            judgment before his death, decreeing the closing
            of accounts when the creditor is still alive, is no man's
            right. On this limit, at least, whoever judges absolutely
            condemns himself absolutely.
            Bemard Fallot of the Masuy gang, working for the
            Gestapo, was condemned to death after admitting the
            many terrible crimes of which he was guilty, and declared
            himself that he could not be pardoned. "My hands
            are too red with blood," he told a prison mate.8 Public
            8 Jean Bocognano: Quartier des fau17es, prison de Fresnes (Editions
            du Fuseau).
            ion and the opinion of his judges certainly classed
            .mu among the irremediable, and I should have been
            tempted to agree if I had not read a surprising testimony.
            This is what Fallot said to the same companion after declaring
            that he wanted to die courageously: "Shall I tell
            you my greatest regret? Well, it is not having known the
            Bible I now have here. I assure you that I wouldn't be
            where I now am." There is no question of giving in to
            some conventional set of sentimental pictures and calling
            ,
            to mind Victor Hugo's good convicts. The age of enlightenment,
            as people say, wanted to suppress the death penalty
            on the pretext that man was naturally good. Of course

            In fact, the supreme punishment has always been,
            throughout the ages, a religious penalty. Inflicted in the
            name of the king, God's representative on earth, or by
            priests or in the name of society considered as a sacred
            body, it denies, not human solidarity, but the guilty
            man's membership in the divine community, the only
            thing that can give him life. Life on earth is taken from
            him, to be sure, but his chance of makina amends is
            left him. The real judgment is not pronou~ced; it will
            Jbe in the other world. Only religious values, and espe-
            ____ cially belief in eterna! life, can therefore serve as a basis
            ,for the supreme pumshment because, accordina to their
            lown logic, they keep it from being definitive ~nd irreparable.
            Consequently, it is justified only insofar as it is
            not supreme.
            The Catholic Church, for example, has always accepted
            the necessity of the death penalty. It inflicted
            that penalty itself, and without stint, in other periods.
            Even today it justifies it and grants the State the right to
            apply it. The Church's position, however subtle, contains
            a very deep feeling that was expressed directly in 1937
            by a Swiss National Councillor from Fribourg during
            a discussion in the National Council. According to
            M. Grand, the lowest of criminals when faced with execution
            withdraws into himself. "He repents and his
            preparation for death is thereby facilitated. The Church
            has saved one of its members and fulfilled its divine
            mission. This is why it has always accepted the death
            penalty, not only as a means of self-defense, but as a
            powerful means of salvation.9 â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ Without trying to
            make of it a thing of the Church, the death penalty can
            point proudly to its almost divine efficacy, like war."
            By virtue of tlle same reasoning, probably, there could
            be read on the sword of the Fribourg executioner the
            words: "Lord Jesus, thou art the judge." Hence the executioner
            is invested with a sacred function. He is the
            man who destroys the body in order to deliver the soul
            to the divine sentence, which no one can judge beforehand.
            Some may think that such words imply rather
            scandalous confusions. And, to be sure, whoever clings
            to the teaching of Jesus will look upon that handsome
            sword as one more outrage to the person of Christ. In the
            light of this, it is possible to understand the dreadful
            remark of the Russian condemned man about to be
            hanged by the Tsar's executioners in 1905 who said
            firmly to the pliest who had come to console him with
            the image of Christ: "Go away and commit no sacri- (
            lege." The unbeliever cannot keep from thinking that I
            men who have set at the center of their faith the staggering
            victim of a judicial error ought at least to hesitate l
            before committing legal murder. Believers might also be
            reminded that Emperor Julian, before his conversion, did
            not want to give official offices to Christians because they

            have anything to do with them. For five centuries Christians
            therefore believed that the strict moral teaching of
            their master forbade killing. But Catholic faith is not
            nourished solely by the personal teaching of Christ. It
            also feeds on the Old Testament, on St. Paul, and on the
            \ Church Fathers. In particular, the immortality of the soul
            !\. and the universal resurrection of bodies are articles of
            dogma. As a result, capital punishment is for the be-
            ~ liever a temporary penalty that leaves the final sentence
            \in suspense, an arrangement necessary only for terrestrial
            order, an administrative measure which, far from
            signifiying the end for the guilty man, may instead favor
            his redemption. I am not saying that all believers agree
            with this, and I can readily imagine that some Catholics
            may stand closer to Christ than to Moses or St. Paul. I
            am simply saying that faith in the immortality of the soul
            allowed Catholicism to see the problem of capital pUly
            ishment in very different terms and to justify it.
            But what is the value of such a justification in the
            society we live in, which in its institutions and its customs
            has lost all contact with the sacred? When an atheistic
            or skeptical or agnostic judge inllicts the death pen-
            alty on an unbelieving criminal, he is pronouncing a
            I definitive punishment that cannot be reconsidered. H;)

            ever, that such a calculation should justify a penalty most
            often inflicted and received in a quite different spirit? It
            is one thing to believe before being afraid and another
            to find faith after fear. Conversion through fire or the
            guillotine will always be suspect, and it may seem surprising
            that the Church has not given up conquering
            infidels through terror. In any case, society that has lost 1
            all contact with the sacred can find no advantage in a !
            conversion in which it professes to have no interest. L.-->decrees a sacred punishment and at the same
            time divests it both of excuse and of usefulness. Society
            proceeds sovereignly to eliminate the evil ones from her
            midst as if she were virtue itself. Like an honorable man
            killing his wayward son and remarking: "Really, I didn't
            know what to do with him." She assumes the right to
            select as if she were nature herself and to add great sufferings
            to the elimination as if she Were a redeeming
            god.
            To assert, in any case, that a man must be absolutely
            Lut off from society because he is absolutely evil amounts
            to saying that society is absolutely good, and no one in L--right mind will believe this today. Instead .of believing
            this, people will. m.ore readily think the reverse. Our
            society has become s.o bad and so criminal only because
            she has respected nothing but her own preservation er a
            good reputation in history. Society has indeed lost all con- !
            tact with the sacred. But society began in the nineteenth

            the end .of time a golden age that justified in advance
            any enterprises whatever. SOciety became accustomed t.o
            legitimizing what might serve her future and, consequently,
            to making use .of the supreme punishment in
            an absolute way. From then on, society considered as a

            such that this mid-century society which has lost the
            -right, in all logics, to decree capital punishment ought
            now to suppress it for reasons of realism.

            bloodshed too is an alcohol that eventually intoxicates
            like the headiest of wines. But the number of individuals
            killed directly by the State has assumed astronomical proportions
            and infinitely outnumbers private murders.
            There are fewer and fewer condemned by common law
            and more and more condemned for political reasons. The
            proof is that each of us, however honorable he may be,
            can foresee the possibility of being someday condemned
            to death, whereas that eventuality would have seemed
            ridiculous at the beginning of the century. Alphonse
            Karr's witty remark: "Let the noble assassins begin" has
            no meaning now. Those who cause the most blood to

            Hence our society must now defend herself not so
            much against the individual as against the State. It may
            be that the proportions will be reversed in another thirty
            years. But, for the moment, our self-defense must ber

            command the law to protect the individual against a
            State given over to the follies of sectarianism or of pride.
            "Let the State begin and abolish the death penalty"
            ought to be our rallying cry today.
            Bloodthirsty laws, it has been said, make bloodthirsty
            customs. But any SOCiety eventually reaches a state of
            ignominy in which, despite every disorder, the custom-
            REFLECTIONS ON THE GUILLOTINE 175
            never manage to be as bloodthirsty as the laws. Half of
            Europe knows that condition. We French knew it in the
            past and may again know it. Those executed during the
            Occupation led to those executed at the time of the liberation,
            whose friends now dream of revenge. Elsewhere
            States laden with too many crimes are getting ready to\

            unless it decides to defend individuals by every meansagainst
            the States oppression? Forbidding a mans execution
            would amount to proclaiming publicly that society 11
            and the State are not absolute values, that nothing aU-j _
            thorizes them to legislate definitively or to bring about ther
            irreparable. Without the death penalty, Gabriel Peri and
            Brasillach would perhaps be among us. We could then
            judge them according to our opinion and proudly proclaim
            our judgment, whereas now they judge us and we
            keep silent. Without the death penalty Rajk's corpse
            would not poison Hungary; Germany, with less guilt on
            her conscience, would be more favorably looked upon by
            Europe; the Russian Revolution would not be agonizing
            in shame; and Algerian blood would weigh less heavily
            on our consciences. Without the death penalty, Europe
            would not be infected by the corpses accumulated for
            the last twenty years in its tired soil. On our continent,
            all values are upset by fear and hatred between individuals
            and between nations. In the conflict of ideas the
            weapons are the cord and the guillotine. A natural and
            human society exercising her right of repression has
            given way to a dominant ideology that requires human
            sacrifices. The example of the gallows, it has been writlW.

            ten,2 is that a mans life ceases to be sacred when it is
            thought useful to kin him. Apparently it is becoming
            f
            ever more useful; the example is being copied; the con,
            tagion is spreading everywhere. And together with it, the
            I disorder of nihilism. Hence we must call a spectacular
            --~ halt and proclaim, in our principles and institutions, that
            the individual is above the State. And any measure that
            decreases the pressure of social forces upon the individual
            will help to relieve the congestion of a Europe suffering
            from a rush of blood, allowing us to think more
            clearly and to start on the way toward hearth. Europe: malady consists in believing nothing and claiming to
            f know everything. But Europe is far from knowing everything,
            and, judging from the revolt and hope we feel,
            she believes in something: she believes that the extreme
            I of man wretchedness, on some mysterious limit, borI
            ders on the extreme of his greatness. For the majority of
            I
            Europeans, faith is lost. And with it, the justifications
            faith provided in the domain of punishment. But the
            majority of Europeans also reject the State idolatry that I aimed to take the place of faith. Henceforth in mid-
            I course, both certain and uncertain, havino made up our
            minds never to submit and never to opp:ess, we should l admit at one and the same time our hope and our ignoran~
            e, we should refuse absolute law and the irreparable
            Judgment. We lmow enough to say that this or that
            major criminal deserves hard labor for life. But we don
            know enough to decree that he be shorn of his futurein
            other words, of the chance we all have of making
            amends. Because of what I have just said, in the unified
            Europe of the future the solemn abolition of the death
            penalty ought to be the first article of the European t
            Code we all hope for. .J

            the executioners of today, as everyone knows, are humanists.
            Hence we cannot be too wary of the humanitarian
            ideology in dealing with a problem such as the
            death penalty. On the point of concluding, I should lik~
            therefore to repeat that neither an illusion as to the natu\
            ral goodness of the human being nor faith in a golden\
            age to come motivates my opposition to the death pen- v alty. On the contrary, its abolition seems to me necessary

            NOt that the heart ha~re in what I have said.
            Anyone who has spent weeks with texts, recollections,
            and men having any contact, whether close or not, with
            the gallows could not possibly remain untouched by that
            experience. But, let me repeat, I do not believe, nonetheless,
            that there is no responsibility in this world and that
            we must give way to that modern tendency to absolve
            everything, victim and murderer, in the same confusion.
            Such purely sentimental confusion is made up of cowardice
            rather than of generosity and eventually justifies
            whatever is worst in this world. If you keep on excusing,
            you eventually give your bleSSing to the slave camp, to
            cowardly force, to organized executioners, to the cynicism
            of great political monsters; you finally hand over
            your brothers. This can be seen around us. But it so happens,
            in the present state of the world, that the man of
            today wants laws and institutions suitable to a convalescent,
            which will curb him without breaking him and
            lead him without crushing him. Hurled into the unchecked
            dynamic movement of history, he needs a natural
            philosophy and a few laws of equilibrium. He needs,
            in short, a society based on reason and not the anarchy
            into which he has been plunged by his own pride and
            the excessive powers of the State.
            I am convinced that abolition of the death penalty
            would help us progress toward that society. After taking
            such an initiative, France could offer to extend it to the
            non-abolitionist countries on both sides of the iron curtain.
            But, in any case, she should set the example. Capi17

            tal punishment would then be replaced by hard laborfor
            life in the case of criminals considered irremediable
            and for a fixed period in the case of the others. To any
            who feel that such a penalty is harsher than capital punishment
            we can only express our amazement that they
            did not suggest, in this case, reserving it fo: such. as
            Landru and applying capital punishment to mmor cnminals.
            We might remind them, too, that hard labor leaves
            the condemned man the possibility of choosing death,
            whereas the guillotine offers no alternative. To any who
            feel, on the other hand, that hard labor is too ,mild a
            penalty, we can answer first that they lack imagination
            and secondly that privation of freedom seems to them a
            slight punishment only insofar as contemporary society
            has taught us to despise freedom.s
            The fact that Cain is not killed but bears a mark of
            reprobation in the eyes of men is the lesson we must
            draw from the Old Testament, to say nothing of the
            Gospels, instead of looking back to the cruel examples of
            the Mosaic law. In any case, nothing keeps us from
            trying out an experiment, limited in duration (ten years,
            for instance), if our Parliament is still incapable of making
            up for its votes in favor of alcohol by such a great
            civilizing step as complete abolition of the penalty. And
            if, really, public opinion and its representatives cannot
            give up the law of laziness which simply eliminates
            what it cannot reform, let us at least-while hoping for
            a new day of truth-not make of it the solemn slaugh-

            in the National Assembly on 31 May 1791: HA sharp and burning
            mood consumes the assassin; the thing he fears most is inactivity;
            it leaves him to himself, and to get away from it he continually
            braves death and tries to cause death in others; solitude and his
            own conscience are his real torture. Does this not suggest to you
            what kind of punishment should be inflicted on him, what is the
            kind of which he will be most sensitive? Is it not in the nature of
            the malady that the remedy is to he found? I have italicized the
            last sentence, for it makes of that little-known Representative a
            true precursor of our modern psychology.

            as it is now applied, and however rarely it may be, is a
            revolting butchery, an outrage inflicted on the person

            The science that serves to kIll so many could at

            would put a little decency into what is at present but a
            sordid and obscene exhibition.
            I suggest such compromises only insofar as on~ I??st
            occasionally despair of seeing wisdom and true clVlhzation
            influence those responsible for our future. For certain
            men, more numerous than we think, it is physically
            unbearable to know what the death penalty really is and
            not to be able to prevent its application. In their way,
            they suffer that penalty themselves, and without any justice.
            If only the weight of filthy images weighing upon
            them were reduced, society would lose nothing. But even
            that, in the long run, will be inadequate. There will be
            no lasting peace either in the heart of individuals or in
            social customs until death is outlawed.
